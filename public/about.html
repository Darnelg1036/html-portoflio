<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Darnel Green i am a entry level coder and web developer, this website is my first try at any type of developing using html. 
  A few projects that ive done in my full stack developer course are linked on the homepage. I truly do hope you enjoy and see the vision of 
  potential that i have with coding.</p>

<p>I can share a few reasons i even considered coding at all, my original profession was a salesman PepsiCo, i did that for 10 years and counting
  But ive always enjoyed building and problem solving way more than anything. Video games for example is my favorite hobby, but 
ive only really fully enjoyed very challenging and competitive video games. Switching to a brand new profession like coding where it can be unruly challengingwhen learning a new language and resulting in building anything was a no brainer for me.
  </p>

<p>The goal is to get better each day with coding and mastering different languages, and to just be the best i can be in this new field study.</p>
